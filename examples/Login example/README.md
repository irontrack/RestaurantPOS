# Login screen example

this is an example of how a login screen should roughly look in the application.

### Things learned

* By using QtWidgets.sizePolicy.minimum for both vert and hori, we get square buttons

* Lambdas were used here  for first time for connections. (this is fine for buttons not created in loops)
