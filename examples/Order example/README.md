# Order Example
 
this is an Example of how a widget that is used to order may look and be coded. The Driver.py

is now where main program is executed. this is done to protect from changes made when updating the 

front end generated by pyuic. 

### Lessons learned

* style sheets can be used to control the appearance of the application

* separate driver with class which inherites the pyuic5 generated Ui can be used to impliment functionality (may not be best approach)

* pop up windows implimented, and new widgets in general, require the main widget to be passed and stored as an atribute in the child call inside Driver.py
